/**
 * A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. 
 * For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, 
 * which means that 28 is a perfect number.
 * A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant 
 * if this sum exceeds n.
 * 
 * As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written 
 * as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers 
 * greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot 
 * be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed 
 * as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
 * Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
